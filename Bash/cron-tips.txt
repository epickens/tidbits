# If a Conda environment is failing to activate while running a script, you can try to activate the environment manually before running the script.

source /home/User/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate your_env 
python your_script.py

# Or you can use "conda run" to run the script with the environment activated:

conda run -n your_env python your_script.py

# Or directly in Cron:

* * * * * /home/User/miniforge3/bin/conda run -n your_env python /path/to/script.py
